This script is capable of turning text into lines while also preserving the insertion points and heights of the text entities. I would now like the lines, that resemble the former text entities, to also have the same orientation/rotation as the text entities used to have. 
Do you have a solution for that using the ezdxf library? 


Layer Manipulation
- Entities
	- Layers
		- colors
			- form dictionary
		- switch all on
		- unlock all
		- unfreeze all

	- Lines

TEXT2LINES
- text 2 lines
	- getting
		- Text
			- Position
			- height
	- convert text 2 lines
		- insert lines at original position with original height
	- create block containing all lines
		- rotate block
			- get rotation from text entities



msp.query('LINE')
for line in lines 
	lines_block.add_line()

Text2Lines_Preserved_InsertionPoint_Height.py
- Rotation Matrix to take rotation values, which are the rotation angles by which the original text entities have been rotated
- Some of the text entities get inserted in the wrong locations
	- Possible issues
		- Coordinate System Differences
		- Incorrect Insertion Points
		- Transformation issues
			- Translation and rotation needs to be applied in the correct order
		- Scaling Factors
			- Maybe check for scaling factors that have been applied to the texts
				- If there were some ... normalize
		- Block references
			- Try getting rid of them first
				- There is now a simple routine to explode blocks
		- Misinterpretation of the position Tuple
	
	- Possible checklist
		- Verify that the correct insertion points are being extracted from the original text entities.
		- Print the insertion points before and after the transformation to ensure they're being transformed as expected.
		- Make sure the transformation matrix is being applied correctly. You might want to test with known values to ensure the transformation is functioning as intended.
		- If the text is inside a block, apply the block reference transformations to the text entity's transformation.
		- Check if the DXF file has any UCS (User Coordinate System) that could be affecting the entity coordinates.

Dimensions
- Explode them the same way I explode blocks
	- search for all the different entities, create a copy, and then delete initial dimensions

Georef
- Checker für WMS erstellt und getestet
	- Checker anpassen für QM Datenaufbereitung: prüfen ob Achsraster von projektiertem Gebäude und neu georeferenzierter Datei innerhalb einer gewissen Toleranz liegen

Dimensions
- Explode Skript erstellt und getestet
	- Ansatz mit nach Entities suchen innerhalb der Bemassung, diese kopieren, in Mapspace einfügen und anschliessend ursprüngliche Dims löschen --> funktioniert

Hatches
- löschen

- Check scaling 
	- I don't think the scaling is the problem. 
		- Rotation and size of the text are correct. 
	--> Insertion points get fucked during ... for whateverthefuck reason they're not correct 
		- Maybe split it in different classes?
			- One class for 

- Insertion Point correct (wellThen.dxf): 2275.344, 1564.701
- Insertion Point fucked up: 374.1873, 2736.1477
	- maybe ... maybe ... the rotation happens around the 0, 0, 0 coordinate of the mapspace ...
		- that would then mean I'd have to rotate all entities at 0, 0, 0 or calculate an "offset" for each insertion point to account for the error.

- Playing with rotations and the corresponding matrices
	- figured out that rotations have to happen at 0, 0, 0 in the global coordinate system. 
		- Therefore if something needs to be rotated, the entity first needs to be moved to 0, 0, 0, then rotated and then moved back
